          Researched and purchased better heat exchanger that alleviated our heat loading problem. Saved company four to six hours of downtime per eight-hour shift and improved product yield at extruder. Purchased and refurbished used gearbox as spare. Saved 12 days downtime and eliminated risk involved to rebuild critical pieces of equipment.
        </p> 

        <h3>Manage People and Projects</h3>

        <p>Successfully led refurbishment campaign on all three extruder gearboxes.  Pro-active rebuild of  gearboxes puts downtime at two days rather than two weeks. Reallocated resources during two-week annual shutdown so that no down time was encountered and all projects finished on time.</p>

        <h3>Extrapolate Essential Data</h3>

        <p>Proved that product quality issue was not due to equipment processing parameters.  Product design team discovered fault in their print test methods. Evaluated trends of real time data on AFG grinder.  Proactive identification of problem prevented  coarse particle contamination. </p>

        <h3>Effective Communication Throughout the Organization</h3>
